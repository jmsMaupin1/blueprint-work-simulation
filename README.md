## Problem

Clinicians need an easy way to give patients assessments, as well as track the metrics from those assessments.

## Solution

Build an app that will allow users to take a brief screening, that will allow clinicians to easily determine which assessments patients should be completing to keep track of the effectiveness of their treatments.

# Tech used, and reasons why

## Next.js

1. Next.js is a framework that uses react, I am very comfortable with react.
2. Next.js is opinionated on how your code should be organized which leads to predictability in your codebase.
3. Makes setting up backend api routes very easy
4. Next.js having the backend and frontend in the same codebase makes types consitent and reliable


## Vercel

1. Vercel makes it easy to deploy full stack applications as well as integrate database software like postgres or mongo
2. Vercel has built in analytics like how many page views, where the users spends most of their time, how fast your web app is, as well as logs for when errors and warnings happen
3. Vercel offers a generous free-tier for hobby projects and is dynamically scalable while still being secure and stable.

# Trade-offs, Things I left out, and Improvements I would've made had I more time

I wanted to add authentication, It would be neat to have an admin interface where say, practices can invite clinicians to join their practice, and clinicians can invite their patients. 

patients would be prompted to take the initial screener on signup, once done the clinicians would be notified of the results and could also keep track of progress and look at past results etc.

To enable that I would have to add a database which is something I was hoping I would be able to get around to doing but ran out of time.

In general I would also have liked to improve the UI.
